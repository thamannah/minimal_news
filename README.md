### Project Description
Minimal News is a simple, clean, and minimalist web application that displays news headlines one at a time. It aims to provide a focused and calm reading experience, keeping users informed without overwhelming them.

### The Problem Statement
The problem we are solving is information overload. With so many news sources today, it’s easy to get overwhelmed with too much information. Our app makes it easy to stay updated with just one headline at a time.

### The Solution
We’ve created a minimalistic news reader that fetches the latest headlines and shows them one by one, allowing users to go through the news at their own pace. No distractions, just the news!
